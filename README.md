Hello and welcome to Rivus SDK for iOS! We offer choice based ad-units and our data proves that choice performs higher on eCPM and while guaranteeing you higher fill rate than competition. To get started - download the SDK, follow the integration instructions, and experience the choice based ad-format.

At this point we are in closed beta therefore if you don't have your Publisher Id, please get in touch with Elise &lt;elise@rivusmedia.com&gt; to have it setup.
